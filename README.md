# Bad-Posture-Detections
This project uses TensorFlow Lite's PoseNet model to detect human poses in images and identify bad posture. The script processes an image, detects key points of the body, and checks for indicators of bad posture such as slouched shoulders, misaligned hips, and forward head position.
